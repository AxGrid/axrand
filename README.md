# Random Number Generation Service

## Overview

The **Random Number Generation Service** is designed to provide high-quality pseudo-random numbers for a variety of applications. This service utilizes the **Mersenne Twister (MT19937)** algorithm, a widely-used and efficient pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) suitable for most general-purpose applications. Additionally, the service supports automatic reseeding after every N requests to enhance randomness.

## Features

- **High Quality Randomness**: The service uses the **Mersenne Twister 19937** algorithm, which provides a long period (2<sup>19937</sup> − 1) and high-quality randomness.
- **Fast and Efficient**: The MT19937 algorithm is optimized for speed and can generate a large volume of random numbers quickly.
- **Customizable Output**: The service supports generation of random integers, 64-bit integers, unsigned 64-bit integers, floating-point numbers, and other common random number formats.
- **Automatic Reseeding**: After every N requests, the random number generator is automatically reseeded to ensure freshness in the generated random sequences.
- **Thread-Safe**: The service can be used safely in multi-threaded environments.

## Mersenne Twister 19937 Algorithm

The **Mersenne Twister (MT19937)** algorithm is a pseudo-random number generator that produces high-quality random numbers. Key features include:

- **Period Length**: The MT19937 has a period of 2<sup>19937</sup> − 1, making it highly unlikely to repeat patterns over a reasonable amount of random number requests.
- **32-bit Word Length**: It operates efficiently using 32-bit words, making it well-suited for modern computing environments.
- **Equidistribution**: The algorithm is 623-dimensionally equidistributed, ensuring good uniformity over a wide range of dimensions.
- **Deterministic**: The MT19937 is deterministic, meaning that for the same initial seed, it will always generate the same sequence of numbers. This is useful for reproducible experiments.

## Reseeding Mechanism

The service supports automatic **re-seeding** of the random number generator after every **N requests**. This ensures that after a defined number of requests, the generator will reset and initialize a new seed either from a random source or a specified one.

This feature improves randomness over time, especially when handling a large number of random number requests, as it prevents the sequence from becoming predictable. The reseeding interval (N) can be configured based on the system requirements.

## API Endpoints

All API requests are made to `/api/` followed by the specific endpoint for random number generation.

### `GET /api/random/integer`

Generates a random integer within a specified range.

#### Parameters:
- `min` (optional): The minimum value of the range (inclusive). Defaults to 0.
- `max` (optional): The maximum value of the range (inclusive). Defaults to 100.

#### Example Request:
```bash
GET /api/random/integer?min=1&max=1000
```

#### Example Response:
```json
{
  "value": 457
}
```

### `GET /api/random/float`

Generates a random floating-point number between 0 and 1.

#### Example Request:
```bash
GET /api/random/float
```

#### Example Response:
```json
{
  "value": 0.6785937
}
```

### `GET /api/random/int64`

Generates a random signed 64-bit integer.

#### Example Request:
```bash
GET /api/random/int64
```

#### Example Response:
```json
{
  "value": 9223372036854775807
}
```

### `GET /api/random/uint64`

Generates a random unsigned 64-bit integer.

#### Example Request:
```bash
GET /api/random/uint64
```

#### Example Response:
```json
{
  "value": 18446744073709551615
}
```


## How It Works

1. **Seeding**: The generator can be seeded manually or use system time by default. It can also be automatically reseeded after a configurable number of requests.
2. **Random Number Generation**: Using the Mersenne Twister MT19937 algorithm, the service generates a sequence of pseudo-random numbers. The numbers can be retrieved via the API in various formats, including 32-bit integers, 64-bit integers, and floating-point numbers.
3. **Automatic Reseeding**: The service will automatically reseed itself after every N requests to ensure freshness in randomness, enhancing its robustness for long-running processes.
4. **Thread Safety**: The service ensures that multiple threads can safely request random numbers without introducing race conditions.

## Usage Notes

- The random numbers generated by this service are **pseudo-random**. If cryptographic security is required, this service may not be suitable for your use case.
- Automatic reseeding is especially important in long-running processes or systems that make frequent requests for random numbers. It helps prevent predictability in the random sequence over time.
